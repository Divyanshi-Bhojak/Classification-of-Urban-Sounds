# Classification-of-Urban-Sounds



Classification of
audio signals are employed using convolutional neural network and VGG-16 for the and dataset used for the implementation is the UrbanSound8K. As a
result of  modelâ€™s output, an input audio file will be classified into one of the
ten classes: Air Conditioner, Car Horn, Children Playing, Dog Bark, Drilling, Engine
Idling, Gun Shot, Jackhammer, Siren, and Street Music. The most important priority
in audio processing is feature extraction, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient
(MFCC) is employed as a feature space for sound samples.
